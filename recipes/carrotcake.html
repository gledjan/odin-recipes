    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p> Delight friends with an afternoon tea that includes this easy carrot cake. You can bake the cake, freeze it and just drizzle over the icing on</p>

    <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul> 
    <li> 175g light muscovado sugar
    <li> 175ml sunflower oil</li>
    <li> 3 large eggs, lightly beaten </li>
    <li> 140g grated carrot (about 3 medium) </li>
    <li> 100g raisins</li>
    <li>  1 large orange, zested </li>
    <li>  175g self-raising flour </li>
    <li>  1 tsp bicarbonate of soda </li>
    <li>  1 tsp ground cinnamon </li>
    <li>  ½ tsp grated nutmeg (freshly grated will give you the best flavour)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Preparation Steps:</h2>

    <ol> 
<li> <em> Step One:</em> Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of an 18cm square cake tin with baking parchment.</li> 
<li> <em> Step Two:</em> Tip the sugar, sunflower oil and eggs into a big mixing bowl. Lightly mix with a wooden spoon. Stir in the carrots, raisins and orange zest.</li> 
<li> <em> Step Three:</em> Sift the flour, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and nutmeg into the bowl. Mix everything together, the mixture will be soft and almost runny. </li> 
<li> <em> Step Four:</em> Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 40-45 mins or until it feels firm and springy when you press it in the centre.</li> 
<li> <em> Step Five:</em> Cool in the tin for 5 mins, then turn it out, peel off the paper and cool on a wire rack. (You can freeze the cake at this point if you want to serve it at a later date.)</li> 
<li> <em> Step Six:</em> Beat the icing sugar and orange juice in a small bowl until smooth – you want the icing about as runny as single cream. Put the cake on a serving plate and boldly drizzle the icing back and forth in diagonal lines over the top, letting it drip down the sides. </li> 
    </ol>
