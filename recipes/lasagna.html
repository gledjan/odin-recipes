    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Having finally relented I discovered that itâ€™s about as simple to make as spag bol, with just one extra (easy) step in making the cheesy bechamel sauce! The mind can play tricks on you it can :) </p>

       <p> I made the traditional lasagna healthier simply by reducing the amount of meat and increasing the amount of vegetables. I also cooked it in some homemade chicken stock.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Vegetables</li>
    <li>Durum Wheat</li>
    <li>Ground Meat</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> <em>Step 1: </em> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. </li>
        <li> <em>Step 2: </em> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown beef and season with salt and pepper; drain. Stir in spaghetti sauce and garlic and simmer 5 minutes.</li>
        <li> <em>Step 3: </em> In a medium bowl, combine mozzarella, Cheddar and ricotta; stir well. In 9x13 inch pan, alternate layers of noodles, meat mixture and cheese mixture until pan is filled.</li>
        <li> <em>Step 4: </em> Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly.        </li>
     </ol>
