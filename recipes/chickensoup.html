    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>  I’ve been a soup lover my entire life. Tony would tell you that it’s true because he’s the one stuck eating my delicious soup recipes that I bust out weekly.</p>

        <p> This chicken soup recipe came to me after I came down with the WORST cold ever. I was on the verge of getting better, then all of a sudden I took a turn for the worst and spent an entire weekend sneezing, coughing and barely able to breathe.</p> 

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Ginger</li>
            <li> Garlic</li>
            <li> Tumeric</li>
            <li> Chicken</li> 
            <li> Pearl/Israeli Couscous</li> 
            <li> Fresh Herbs</li>
        </ul> 
    <h2>Preparation Steps: </h2>
<ol>
<li> <em> Step 1:</em> Place a large dutch oven or pot over medium high heat and add in oil. Once oil is hot, add in garlic, onion, carrots and celery; cook for a few minutes until onion becomes translucent </li>
<li> <em> Step 2:</em> Next add in grated ginger and grated turmeric. Saute for 30 seconds to let the spices cook a bit, then add in chicken broth, chicken breast, rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper.</li>
<li> <em> Step 3:</em> Bring soup to a boil, then stir in couscous. You’ll want the chicken to be covered by the broth so make sure you stir them down to the bottom. </li>
<li> <em> Step 4:</em> Reduce heat to medium low and simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked.</li>
<li> <em> Step 5:</em>Once chicken is cooked, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a cutting board to shred with two forks. Add chicken back to pot then stir in frozen peas. If you find that you don't have enough broth, feel free to add in another cup. Everyone likes their soup differently. Taste and adjust seasonings, if necessary. Enjoy.</li>
